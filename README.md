# About this config

The current config aims at serving as a simple, but effective environment
to write simple projects in rust, c, c++, python and javascript.

The configuration itself is heavily based on the `From 0 to IDE in NEOVIM from scratch`
Youtube series by `@typecraft`. The link to the channel is displayed below in the appropriate
section. 

# Current state

The configuration is currently largely incomplete and a lot of the most basic functionality
provided by most, if not all, IDEs is missing. 

Please do not use.

The items below are to be included in the config. The order in which they are
listed does not represent their priority.
